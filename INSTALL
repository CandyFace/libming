Installing Ming

Last updated 2nd February 2004.

Unfortunately we haven't made Ming use autoconf yet.  If you'd like
to help with this, please let us know!

  Unpack the Ming source tarball and go into the uncompressed
  directory.

    $ gunzip ming-0.3beta1.tar.gz
    $ tar xfp ming-0.3beta1.tar
    $ cd ming


  PHP
  ***

  (should work with PHP-4.0.2 and higher)

  The preferred method is to build Ming as a PHP module (.so file):

   1. Compile the main Ming library

      $ make
      $ make static

   2. Compile the PHP module

      $ cd php_ext
      $ make

   3. Install the PHP module

      $ make install

   4. Configure PHP to load Ming.  You need to adjust your
      php.ini file, normally by adding:

      extension=php_ming.so

      to the extension section, and also making sure the
      "extension_dir" parameter in the php.ini file is pointing
      to the correct directory.  A common default of the php.ini
      file is to be pointing to "./", which may need adjusting.


   The alternative way is to build Ming into the PHP source:

      $ mkdir <phpdir>/ext/ming
      $ cp php_ext/* <phpdir>/ext/ming
      $ cd <phpdir>
      $ ./buildconf
      $ ./configure --with-ming=<mingdir> <other config options>

   Then build and install php as usual, then restart your web server.


  PYTHON
  ******

  (You may need python 1.5.2 or higher)

      $ make static
      $ cd py_ext
      $ make mingcmodule.so

  Then fix the install path in the Makefile

  Then install

      $ make install


  PERL
  ****

  Read the README file in the perl_ext subdirectory.
