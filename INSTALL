Installing Ming

Last updated 18th January 2004.

Unfortunately we haven't made Ming use autoconf yet (if you'd like
to, please let us know!)

  Unpack the Ming source tarball and go into the uncompressed
  directory.

    $ gunzip ming-0.3alpha2.tar.gz
    $ tar xfp ming-0.3alpha2.tar
    $ cd ming

  Decide whether you want to include gif or png image format
  handling in Ming, then adjust the ming_config.h, config.make,
  and Makefile to suit your system.

    $ vi <the appropriate files>


  PHP
  ***

  (should work with PHP-4.0.2 and higher)

  The preferred method is to build Ming as a PHP module (.so file):

   1. Compile the main Ming library

      $ make
      $ make static

   2. Compile the PHP module

      $ cd php_ext
      $ make

   3. Install the PHP module

      $ make install

   4. Configure PHP to load Ming.  You need to adjust your
      php.ini file, normally by adding:

      extension=php_ming.so

      to the extension section, and also making sure the
      "extension_dir" parameter in the php.ini file is pointing
      to the correct directory.  A common default of the php.ini
      file is to be pointing to "./", which may need adjusting.


   The alternative way is to build Ming into the PHP source,
   though I'm personally not sure (Justin that is) if it still
   works.  If you get this working successfully (or not), please
   let me know at <jclift@digitaldistribution.com> and we'll update
   the documentation to reflect it.

      $ mkdir <phpdir>/ext/ming
      $ cp php_ext/* <phpdir>/ext/ming
      $ cd <phpdir>
      $ ./buildconf
      $ ./configure --with-ming=<mingdir> <other config options>

   Then build and install php as usual, and restart the web server
   if necessary.
      

  PYTHON
  ******

  (You may need python 1.5.2 or higher)

      $ make static
      $ cd py_ext
      $ make mingcmodule.so

  Then fix the install path in the Makefile

  Then install

      $ make install


  PERL
  ****

  Read the README file in the perl_ext subdirectory.
