INSTALL

- Extract in the ming main directory

>cd py_ext 

if platform == '*** UNIX ***':

	- then just type

	>python build.py

	- then follow instructions

elif platform == '*** WINDOWS ***':
	
	# probably get a binary mingc.pyd from the web site?
	# or maybe:
	
	> make
	
	> make install

>python shape.py

- It will generate the file shape.swf, 

Have Fun!
