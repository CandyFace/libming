This is a simple c++ wrapper for ming which lets you use objects in more
or less the same way you would with PHP or Python.  Note that the include
paths are stuck to the current directory structure, most notably in this
ming.h's #include of that other ming.h one level up.  If you're going to
use this for anything, you'll have to work that out.
