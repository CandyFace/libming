This list should always be empty:

	- add SWFShape_drawCubic and SWFShape_drawCubicTo ????
	- Add SWF::TextField method pod
	- test under mod_perl (check $m->out)
	- Make sure all open files are closed (e.g. Bitmap)
	- Add a SUPPORT file - I'm getting too many private emails
	- Fix Email address
	- Update README file, it's out of date

This is wish list:

	1- Simple interface
	2- XML
	3- proper example + mod_perl examples
