=head1 TODO

=head2 Feature Synchronization

make all functions that ming provides to the perl-extension too.
Currently missing: 

ButtonRecord modifying functions 

=head2 CPAN

Setup the build environment, files and directories for distribution on cpan 
in a way that the ming-perl extension can be built on cpan automatically.

=head1 Documentation

write pod documentation for the SWF modules

=head2 Tests

There are currently some very few tests in t. But there is a growing number 
of tests in ming lib itself, that can be run currently by

./configure --enable-perl
make
make check

They should be available when building on cpan too.
